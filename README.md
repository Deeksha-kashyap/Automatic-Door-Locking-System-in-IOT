# SYNOPSIS
# Automatic-Door-Locking-System-in-IOT
# Introduction
This simple fingerprint door unlock project using Arduino can be very useful for door security, forensics, crime investigation, personal
identification, attendance system and much more. In the future, there could be many more applications like fingerprint-based driving
licenses, bank accounts operation and so on.
The whole system works under a simple algorithm called matching algorithm, which is used to compare previously-stored templates of 
fingerprints against users’ fingerprints for authentication purposes. A key is normally used for traditional door opening, but it
provides very poor security. In this fingerprint door unlock project, only when an authorized person places a finger on the sensor,
the door unlocks and the LCD displays a welcome message along with that person’s name.

# Scope

1.	Security.
2.	No risk of misplacing.
3.	Cost-effective.
4.	User-friendly.
5.	Difficulty in overriding.

# Function
Smart locks are sure to become every homeowner’s favorite. They offer the same level of security as typical mechanical door locks but
provide a range of alternatives to the mechanical key and a host of other features. Digital locks are changing our lifestyle, leading
us to a new digital era of keyless locking!

# Tools Required
•	Arduino UNO
•	Fingerprint sensor module
•	0.96 inch OLED display
•	Breadboard
•	Jumper wires

# Role of Group Member’s individually
Abhishek Raghav - Design the layout.

# Conclusion
To sum up, a security fingerprint lock is secure, affordable, non-intrusive, and foolproof. Access can be granted to multiple individuals
and revoked according to your convenience. Whether it is your home or your office, consider getting a fingerprint door lock installed for optimum security and peace of mind.
